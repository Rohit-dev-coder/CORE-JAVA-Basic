Some Points about Abstract:

1. An abstract class is a class that contains 0 or more abstract methods.
2. An abstract class can contain instance variables and concrete methods in addition to abstract methods.
3. Abstract Class and the abstract methods should be declared by using the keyword 'abstract'.
4. All the abstract methods of the abstract class should be implemented (body) in its sub classes.
5. If any abstract method is not implemented, then that sub class should be declared as 'abstract'. In this case
    ,we cannot create an object to the sub class. We should create another sub class to this sub class and implement
    the remaining abstract method there.
6. We cannot create an object to abstract class. But we can create a reference of abstract class type.
7. The reference of abstract class can be used to refer to objects of its subclasses.
8. The reference of abstract class can not be refers to individual method of its subclasses.
9. It is possible to drive an abstract class as a sub class from a concrete super class.
10. We cannot declare a class as both abstract and final. Example 
        abstract final class A  //invalid
    because the keyword abstract represents an incomplete class which depends on the sub classes for its implementation
    Creating sub class is compulsory for abstract class. Final key word prevents inheritance. This means, we cannot
    create sub class to a final class.
    So, the key words abstract and final are contradictory and hence both can not be used simultaneously for a class.
