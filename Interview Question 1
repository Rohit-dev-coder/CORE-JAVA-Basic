Q What is Coercion?
Coercion is the automatic conversion between different data types done by the compiler.

Q What is Conversion?
Conversion is an explicit change in the data type specified by the cast operator.

Q. What is method signature?
Method signature represents the method name along with method parameters.

Q. What is method overloading?
Writing two or more methods in the same class in such way that each method has same name but different method signatures
is called method overloading.

Q. What is method overriding?
Writing two or more methods in super and sub classes such that the method have same name and same signatures is called
method overriding.


few points about method overloading.
1. Writing two or more methods with same name but with different signatures is called method overloading.
2. Method overloading is done in the same class.
3. Return type can be same or different.
4. JVM decides which method is called depending on the difference in the method signatures.
5. It is done when the programmer wants to extend the already available feature.
6. Its a code refinement.

few points about method overriding.
1. Writing two or more methods with same name and same signatures is called method overloading.
2. Method overriding is done in super and sub class.
3. Method return type should be same.
4. JVM decides which method is called depending on the data types (class) of the object used to call the method.
5. It is done when the programmer wants to provide a different  implementation(body) for the same feature.
6. Its a code replacement.
