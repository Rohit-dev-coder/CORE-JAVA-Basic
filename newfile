Q.  Difference b/w System.out and System.err?

System.out and System.err both represent the moniter by default and hence can be used to send data
or results to the moniter. System.out is used to display normal messages and results,. whereas System.err is used to display error
messages.

Q.  On which memory, arrays are created in java?

Arrays are created on dynamic memory by JVM. There is no question of static memory in java;
everything (Variable, array, object etc..) is created on dynamic  memory only.


Q.  Is String a class or data type?

String is class in java.lang package. But in java, All classes are also considered as data types. So we can take String
as a data type also.
Can we call a class as a data type?
Yes, a class is also called 'user-defined' data types. This  is because a user can create a class.

String class methods:
1. String concat(String s):
2. int length():
3. char charAt(int i):
4. int compareTo(String s)
5. int compareToIgnoreCase(String s)
6. boolean equals(String s)
7. boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String s)
8. boolean startWith(String s)
9. boolean endsWith(String s)
10. int indexOf(String s)
11. int lastIndexOf(String s)
12. String replace(char ch1, char ch2)
13. String substring(int i)
14. String substring(int i, int j)
15. String toLowerCase()
16. String toUpperCase()
17. String trim()
18. void getChars(int i1, int i2,char arr[], int i3)
19. String[] split(delimiter)




Q what is object reference?

Object reference is a unique hexadecimal number representing the memory address of the object.
It is useful to access the members of the object.


Q Difference between == and equals()?

== operators compares the references of the string objects. it does not compare the contents of the object. equals()
method compares the contents. while comparing the strings, equals() method should be used as it yields the correct result.


Q Difference b/w 
    String s ="Hello";
    String s = new String("Hello");

In first statement, assignment operator is used to assign the string literal to the String variable s.
In this case, JVM first of all checks whether the same object is already available in the string constant pool.
If it is available, then it creates another reference to it. If the same object is not available, then it creates 
another object with the content "Hello" and stores it  into string constant pool.
Second Statement, new operator is used to create the string object. In this case, JVM always creates a new object 
without looking in the string constant pool.


Q. String v/s StringBuffer Classes?

String class objects are immutable and hence their contents cannot be modified. StringBuffer class objects are mutable.
So they can be modified. Moreover the methods that directly manipulate data of the object are not available in string 
class. Such methods are available in StringBuffer class.


StringBuffer Class Methods
1. append(x)  --x may be boolean,int,char,string etc
2. insert(int i,x)
3. delete(int i, int j)
4. reverse();
5. length()
6. indexOf(String str)
7. lastIndexOf(String str)
8. replace(int i, int j, String str)
9. String substring(int i)
10. String substring(int i,int j)
